[{"text": " I would like to mention that a couple of days ago, Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber. And what you want to do to Joe the plumber, and me and some more like him, is have their taxes increased. That's what Joe believes. He's been watching some ads of Senator McCain's. Let me tell you what I'm actually going to do. You know what Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the Plumber? We need to spread the wealth around. It is true that my friend and supporter Warren Buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes. We're talking about Joe the Plumber. In order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the Plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000.", "timestamp": [0, 48.16], "truthiness": 0.6}, {"text": " And frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.", "timestamp": [48.56, 53.14], "truthiness": 0.7}, {"text": " Senator Obama, I am not President Bush.", "timestamp": [53.68, 55.9], "truthiness": 1.0}, {"text": " If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.", "timestamp": [56.26, 59.38], "truthiness": 1.0}, {"text": " I'm going to give a new direction to this economy in this country.", "timestamp": [59.84, 63.48], "truthiness": 0.5}, {"text": " The notion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who's looked at this claim that Senator McCain keeps on making. Even Fox News disputes it. And that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me. Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history, and I can prove it. 100%, John, of your ads, 100% of them have been negative. It's not true. 100% It absolutely is true. The allegation that Senator McCain's continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling. Let me tell you who I associate with. On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me. And you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers' living room. That's absolutely not true. And the facts are facts and records are records. And that's not true. For far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration, with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude's been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement. Free trade with Colombia is something that's a no-brainer. Joe, the plumber's out there. Joe, Senator Obama's plan, if you're a small business and you've got employees and you've got kids, if you don't get adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's going to fine you. And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there. Here's your fine. Zero. I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be a part of those qualifications, but I certainly would not be someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications. But I certainly would not impose any litmus test. All right. I would not provide a litmus test. But I am somebody who believes that Roe v. Wade was rightly decided. It's great to be with you again. I think we've had a very healthy discussion.
